/**
 * A blocking queue is defined as a queue which blocks the caller of the enqueue method
 * if thereâ€™s no more capacity to add the new item being enqueued. Similarly,
 * the queue blocks the dequeue caller if there are no items in the queue.
 * Also, the queue notifies a blocked enqueuing thread when space becomes available
 * and a blocked dequeuing thread when an item becomes available in the queue.
 *
 * @param <T> "size" queue size at any point in time
 *            "capacity" total capacity that queue can have
 *            "head" pointer to the front of the queue
 *            "tail" pointer to the back of the queue
